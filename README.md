### Hello beautiful human âœ¨ I'm Shannon!

I graduated from Drake University with a degree in computer science. I spent a decade making art, writing comics and fiction, and doing some web dev, then spent 2 years developing a collaborative research platform at Washington University School of Medicine.

I went on sabbatical at the end of 2021: during this time I traveled, built a [game in Go](https://github.com/mroobit/untitled-sidescroller), and tried new-to-me technologies. Recently I completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), where I started designing and implementing a non-textual programming language.

- Currently working on [Sketchlang](https://shannondybvig.com/projects/sketchlang/), a sketch-based programming language
- Currently learning how to train CV models
- Always reading - ask me about my recent favs ðŸ“˜
